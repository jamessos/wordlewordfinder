# wordlewordfinder
This is a website I made back when wordle was popular. It gives the words that fit criterias entered from a list of words that wordle uses. 

When entering in criterias. green indicates possible positions for a letter and yellow indicates positions where the letter canâ€™t take up.

A website version can be found on https://wordlewordfinder.weebly.com/
